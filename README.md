###Stripper

Stripper is a single executable javascript file and chrome extension, that will strip away all distractions from a page for easy reading or printing.

###What does Stripper do?

She strips! 
Menus, Sidebars, Footers... basically she makes sure the post you're reading is all that you need to focus on. Happy Reading. :)

###Coming Features:

Some blog formats are tricky, and stip the title from the actual blog post. In these cases you'll lose the main title.
My next goal is to fix this. Preferably by using the xml rss feed instead of actually grabbing the post element. But until then I'm trying to add more and more blogs to support.
